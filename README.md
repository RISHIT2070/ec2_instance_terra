# Terraform EC2 Instance Template

This Terraform template creates an EC2 instance in AWS with a specified AMI, instance type, key pair, and subnet. It also creates two security groups for SSH and HTTP access, and runs a simple shell script on launch.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory.

2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following variables:

```
ami_id      = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
key_name    = "my-key-pair"
subnet_id   = "subnet-0123456789abcdef0"
```

3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.

4. Run `terraform apply` to create the EC2 instance.

5. After the instance is created, you can SSH into it using the key pair specified in `terraform.tfvars`.

## Files

- `instance.tf`: Defines the EC2 instance resource.

- `variables.tf`: Defines the input variables for the template.

- `security_groups.tf`: Defines the security groups for SSH and HTTP access.

- `userdata.sh`: A simple shell script that runs on launch.

- `README.md`: This file.

## Commands

- `terraform init`: Initializes the working directory.

- `terraform apply`: Creates the EC2 instance.

- `terraform destroy`: Destroys the EC2 instance.

## Example Output

```
Outputs:

instance_ip = "X.X.X.X"
